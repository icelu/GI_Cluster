Datasets and scripts used for comparing tools for predicting genomic islands (GIs)

--------------------------------
C-dataset:
This dataset includes GIs predicted by comparative genomics

L-dataset:
This dataset includes GIs collected from literature

incomplete_dataset:
This dataset includes GIs collected from literature for incomplete genomes.

Python scripts for evaluating the predictions of genome islands by different methods.

--------------------------------
GIs in C-dataset and L-dataset are based on the evaluation datasets used in paper [1].
Among the 11 genomes, we excluded two genomes with fewer than six GIs in L-data set.
For L-data set, we added additional GIs predicted by Islander and in literature or refined island boundaries according to known annotations.
We also included GIs predicted in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LESB58 in L-data set, which has been well studied in terms of GIs.

As a result, 10 genomes from six orders were used, including
Burkholderiales (Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315; Bordetella petrii DSM 12804),
Corynebacteriales (Corynebacterium diphtheriae NCTC 13129),
Enterobacteriales (Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC BAA-894; Escherichia coli CFT073; Proteus mirabilis HI4320; Salmonella typhi CT18),
Rhizobiales (Bartonella tribocorum CIP 105476), and Lactobacillales (Streptococcus equi 4047),
and Pseudomonadales (Pseudomonas aeruginosa LESB58).

In addition, for eight known integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are (ICEPmiUSA1, ICEPm1, ICESe2, ICE-GI1, ICE-GI2, ICE-GI3, ICE-GI6 and SPI-7), we used boundaries from ICEberg database (http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEberg/), expect for ICE-GI2 and ICE-GI3.
Since ICE-GI2 (from 1350129 to 1493558) and ICE-GI3 (from 1493541 to 1595651) are overlapping, we combine them into one, denoted as ICE-GI2(3).

For C-data set, there are positive datasets (GIs) and negative datasets (non-GIs) for nine of these genomes (except P. aeruginosa LESB58).

GIs in incomplete_dataset are collected in paper [5].

There are very few known GIs from incomplete genomes in literature.
We collected 17 known GIs (312,686 bp) from Vibrio cholerae RC9, which were predicted as five or more consecutive ORFs sporadically distributed among related strains (see paper [5]).
The incomplete genome of V. cholerae RC9  (Accession: ACHX00000000) contains 11 contigs and 4,211,011 bp.
V. cholerae RC9 has two chromosomes, with
11 GIs locating at the large chromosome and 6 GIs at the small chromosome.
But it is unknown which contigs are from which chromosomes.
According to the reference GIs, contig 7 and 9 are on the small chromosome, whereas contig 6, 10 and 11 are on the large chromosome.
